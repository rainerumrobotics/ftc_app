     * To enable this opmode you can either remove the @Disabled annotation,
     * or place a // comment in front of it.
     *
     * To create a robot configuration you will need to upload this TeamCode project to the
     * Robot Controller (RC) phone. You can select/create then any configuration from the menu
     * Configure Robot.
     * If you install this app for the first time you will need to create a new configuration.
     * This can be done by either connecting USB controller hub to the phone and/or by performing
     * a scan of the current hardware, or by selecting a preinstalled template like SquareBot for
     * example, or an combination of both. Save the configuration with some name.
     *
     * Finally activate the configuration by selecting its name on the list and press Activate.
     *
     * Bot hardware configuration for REV Robotics Expansion Hub:
     *  - Motor Controller:
     *    Port 1 - Left DC motor, "left_drive", REV Robotics Core Hex Motor
     *    Port 2 - Right DC motor, "right_drive", REV Robotics Core Hex Motor
     *  - Device Interface Module (not used in this code):
     *    Analog Port 0 - Optical distance sensor
     *    Digital Port 0 - Touch sensor
